1. Enhance the UX scrolling of menu items
2. Use dynamic informations to update the menu items (fixed)
3. Why you used useEffect, useStates?

*1. Font bug by @import  font (fix by taking the value from the api parse that in a different css file)
Bug reproduce: Must use App router
First, have one font import
Second, other css file import, but that file must have content
=> you got a bug

*2. css background style bug (fix by  doing inline style (not good for accessibility)), Must use App router

*3. Fix the bug where you click onto select item in OrderMenu (in orderOnline), vertical scrollbar appear
unintended

Fixed: adding padding-bottom onto list for list to take more space

*4. Make arrow function in orderOnline so that It works as intended (scroll 2 3 items at once) 

*5. Refactor the Summary list so that It works like a stack (It gives the feel of smooth  inn and out while
picking different foods.. Because When we scale this to 10 items, It gonna be a mess) 

=> Adding SummaryList useState variable to handle Summary items stacking

*6. When proceed to checkout as a phone user, you don't know that some fields need to be filled (required) 
- Suggested focussing onto input fields that seeing errors (which has classList of invalid)
- changed to scrollintoView due to focus bug

=> Added as suggested; adding 2 lines onto Validator which handle the case

*7. Adding VNpay Function using datas provided from customers (backend oriented)

*8. When customers hasnt choosed the menu item yet, highlight text (orderForm onSubmit block code)
=> Added another useEffect to handle changing in dataList

*9. Using <Image> components from Next to optimise images (cause it is loading slow on mobile for no reason)

*10. Adding margin-left: 12px onto forward arrow to actually seperate those

*11. Flipping arrows
    
*12. Change the name of the order instead of selectedValue => Quantity

13. Use vnp IPN to tell customers that the order has been made

14. Figure out why must I have to use useEffect and useState to actually make GetCurrentSlug works?

15. If you clicked too fast onto hamburgermenu, it is expected to bugged out, cant really fix it
