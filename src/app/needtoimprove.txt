1. Enhance the UX scrolling of menu items
2. Use dynamic informations to update the menu items (fixed)
3. Why you used useEffect, useStates?

1. Font bug by @import  font (fix by taking the value from the api parse that in a different css file)
Bug reproduce: Must use App router
First, have one font import
Second, other css file import, but that file must have content
=> you got a bug

2. css background style bug (fix by  doing inline style (not good for accessibility)), Must use App router

3. Fix the bug where you click onto select item in OrderMenu (in orderOnline), vertical scrollbar appear
unintended

There's a workaround on this: you can remove the margin bottom on description, reset 
the height so that select can contain the height
Fixed: adding padding-bottom onto list for list to take more space

4. Make arrow function in orderOnline so that It works as intended (scroll 2 3 items at once)

5. Refactor the Summary list so that It works like a stack (It gives the feel of smooth  inn and out while
picking different foods.. Because When we scale this to 10 items, It gonna be a mess)
