You are now eligible to deploy!

Things to do after (must, because you used vnpay)

Do some NextJS server action to store + fetch files from static public assets (this is not stores on server, so you 
can deploy it first)
Research onto returnurl and ipnURL

And that's all there is. 6/9/2023, wish you luck fixing the bug after deploy :D
